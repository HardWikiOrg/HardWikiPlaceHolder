# HardWikiPlaceHolder
Deterministic, stake-backed facts for a probabilistic AI era

Whitepaper Abstract
Hard Wiki is a permissionless, cryptographically‑verified ledger of scientifically testable facts, proofs, and experimental results.
By anchoring machine‑checkable artifacts on‑chain, backed by: human staking, a native HARD token, and Sybil‑resistant identity, 
we create a permanent knowledge substrate that large‑language models, researchers, and institutions can trust without re‑fact‑checking each inference.

## 🔍 What is Hard Wiki?
Hard Wiki is an Ethereum roll-up + content-addressed storage layer where:


| 1. Authors prove humanity (World ID) and lock a **stake bond**. |
| 2. They publish a **Typed Claim**: `Theorem | Experiment | Computation`. |
| 3. Deterministic proofs (SNARKs) or container hashes are stored **on-chain**. |
| 4. Peers can **Challenge ⚙︎** (automatic) or **Flag ⚑** (DAO review) within 30 days. |
| 5. Invalid claims are **slashed**; solid ones become immutable citations (`hard://...`)
